# Turbofan-Engine-Remaining-Life-Prediction
Trained LSTM and Transformer models on the NASA CMAPSS engine dataset to predict remaining useful life (RUL). The Transformer model achieved RMSE ≈ 21, reducing prediction error by ~75% and improving R² by 0.32 compared to LSTM, demonstrating significant accuracy gains.
